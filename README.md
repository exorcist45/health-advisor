This is a group project that I worked on with three other fellow classmates for the Android Mobile Application Development course from March to May 2022. The goal of this project was to create a health advisor app which can create awareness among people along with providing them with proper resources. We accomplished creating a stylistic and functional Android app using Android Studio and mySQL to manage a database of questions/answers.
